# Data-Project
A simulation of our game written in python
Our game "Pathways of Doom & Destruction" is simulated in this repository.
By running 10,000 trials, the computer gave these results:

  Number of trials:  10000

  Number of wins (single player):  1482 Number of losses:  8518

  Expected value:  -2.4744

  Player 1 Wins:  4966 Player 2 Wins:  5034

A win is considered when the player makes it to the end of the board without hitting a mine
In this case the player made it to the end 1,482 times out of 10,000 which is 14.82% chance of winning.

Taking into account the buy in price to play the game, the expected number of points a player will win is -2.47.

To showcase this is a 50-50 chance random game in beating someone if playing with others, the program 
simulated 2 players against each other. Player 1 won 4,966 times compared to player 2's 5,034.
This is almost exactly 50-50 relative to each other. 

A player record sheet is included showing 50 rounds of the game being played.
